# VCDS-Analyst
This program is used to open Log files generated by Ross-Tech's VCDS Software Application for the purpose of data analysis. 
The goal of this project is to have a fully functional analyzer that can synchronize block timestamps and provide alerts, as well as useful information about what the sensors reported during the Log. This should be handy to the layman who wants an in depth picture of their car's performance.
